# covid-19

This a data science project that made use of some datasets containing information about the covid-19 cases around the world. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and FPDF), Jupyter notebooks, git and github pages. The project with its main steps can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/covid-19/) and the generated report can be accessed [here](https://github.com/mateusmelo821/covid-19/blob/main/report.pdf).
